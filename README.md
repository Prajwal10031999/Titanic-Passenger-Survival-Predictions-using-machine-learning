# Titanic-Survival-Predictions-using-machine-learning
A machine learning model to predict the survived passengers from the titanic disaster.

Libraries used : <br />
Numpy <br />
Pandas <br />
Matplotlib <br />
Sklearn <br />

I will be testing the following models with my training data : <br />

Gaussian Naive Bayes <br />
Logistic Regression <br />
Support Vector Machines <br />
Perceptron <br />
Decision Tree Classifier <br />
Random Forest Classifier <br />
KNN or k-Nearest Neighbors <br />
Stochastic Gradient Descent <br />
Gradient Boosting Classifier <br />
For each model, we set the model, fit it with 80% of our training data, predict for 20% of the training data and check the accuracy. <br />

Lastly a csv file named submission.csv will be created which will contain list of passenger names & whether they survived or not?
